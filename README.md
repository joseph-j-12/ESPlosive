[This] https://github.com/joseph-j-12/CppEngine is the original repo for the project.

This repo is just a variant of the original project made to run on a microcontroller like the esp32/esp8266.
Download this and put it in the libraries folder in arduino.


Note that this will not run on AVR boards due to the limited c++ support
